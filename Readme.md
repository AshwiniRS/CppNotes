# C++

**What is C++?**
C++ is the programming language that primarily is used for applications which demands energy consumption, speed and performance. 

## Chapter 1 : Getting Started
### 1.1 Writing simple C++ program:
Every C++ program has one or more functions in which one must be named as **main** . The OS runs C++ program by calling main function.

Every function has **four** elements:
		- a return type
		- a function name
		- parameter list enclosed in parenthesis
		- function body
		
Consider following sample main() function in C++.
``` 
int main(){
	return 0;
}
```
In the above code snippet the four elements are:
	- a return type - int
	- a function name - main
	- parameter list enclosed in parenthesis - no parameters hence empty parenthesis
	- function body - block of statements enclosed in curly braces.

A return value from function indicates the success or failure of function. *Return value of 0 indicates success and a nonzero indicates what kind of error occurred.*
